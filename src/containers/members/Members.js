                            I am a senior studying for a B.S. in Computer Science in the
                            Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the University
                            of Hawaii. I love creating various kinds of software, from web apps 
                            to video games. I love the problem solving aspect of software engineering 
                            as it challenges me to be more creative. As such, I find developing 
                            video games a good way to work my technical skills and creativity.

                            I am senior at the University of Hawaii currently pursuing my BS in 
                            Computer Science and a certificate in Creative Computational Media. 
                            I have a passion for video games and love the process of creating them, 
                            whether itâ€™s coding the functionality or creating assets. I hope to one 
                            day create my own video game by myself from scratch like Stardew Valley 
                            or Undertale.

                            I am a senior at UH Manoa working in 3D animation. I worked on asset 
                            development and level design aspects of the game. I also led the creative 
                            side of things designing puzzles and figuring out mechanics. This is my first 
                            time working with a group of programmers on a game project.
